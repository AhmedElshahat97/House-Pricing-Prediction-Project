# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project ‚Äì Housing Price Prediction

This is the final project of the **Data Analysis with Python** course from the [IBM Data Analyst Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst).

## Project Summary

As a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust, I was tasked with building a predictive model to estimate house prices based on different features such as:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Number of floors
- Year built, and more.

The dataset includes residential house sales in **King County, Seattle**, between May 2014 and May 2015.

The goal was to:
- Analyze the data
- Visualize key insights
- Build and evaluate regression models
- Provide a reliable way to predict housing prices

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was provided by IBM and includes:
- Features: sqft_living, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, waterfront, condition, grade, etc.
- Target: Price of the house

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** ‚Äì for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** ‚Äì for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì for regression modeling and evaluation

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Feature Engineering
- Simple & Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial & Ridge Regression
- Model Evaluation using R¬≤, M

## Results

The final model was able to predict housing prices with a good performance. Techniques like **Ridge Regression** and **Cross-Validation** helped reduce overfitting and improve generalization on unseen data.
